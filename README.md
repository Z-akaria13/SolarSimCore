# SolarSimCore
The core modules to handle generation and representation of systems in 2.5D; on the galactic and solar level.

Will generate galaxy and starsystems to low detail, providing different galaxy types with regions of fluctuating star density and types.

It shall allow rendering of and transport between the stars, within a given radius. 

No logistics such as time or life etc, just basic startypes, instant transport and planet types.
